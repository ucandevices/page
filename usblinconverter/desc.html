<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Usb LIN(Local interconnect network) Converter(ULC) works as LIN to USB converter. Two communications port exist, USB(virtual COM port) and side USART port. UCCB can work both with PC or Your custom embedded device. Multiple features are supported like:
  <li> LIN 2.1 support</li>
	<li>Listen only mode, for all frame reception, and sending single frames.</li>
	<li>Master mode, with up to 15 frame slots</li>
	<li>19200 baud rate</li>	
  <li>External 7-12V is needed for LIN network</li>
  <li>Device size is 31x18 mm (without USB connector)</li>
  <li>Termination resistors controlled by software</li>
  <li>USB dfu compatible bootlader for new features</li>
  <li>SLCAN compatible, works with LINUX socket-can and some of CAN-utils</li>

<p>After USB enumeration device creates virtual COM port that is used both for data transfer and converter setup.
     Frames are send on USART only if no HOST is connected to USB. 
     Device is be powered directly from USB, External 12V is needed to supply LIN transcriver. 
     Board layout is shown below.<br>

<h3>Drivers</h3>
<p>For proper work on Windows no special drivers are needed </p>
<h3>COM port Commands</h3>
<p>
    Below is list of all available commands. All those commands can be send by USB or P4 port USART.
    USART baud rate is virtual so can be any. For the newest list see SLCAN.c file in source codes.
    All commands are ASCI based. Commands are line based and terminated with newline character CR (0xD). 
    On error the device responses with 0x7. 
    To start LIN frame reception just type "L" as Listen mode command.

<tr>
<td>riiil</td>
<td>In Silent mode, transmits header only with set ID and Lenght, subscibed slave should answer the header.<br>
    In Master mode, puts or updates table set with this id for continous sending.
    Proper timing is set according to LIN standard. <br>
