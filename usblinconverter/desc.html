<h3>Description</h3>
<p>LIN(Local interconnect network) Usb Converter(LUC) can work both with PC without any additional drivers,
     it creates virtual COM port that handles LIN communication. 
Multiple features are supported like:
  <li> LIN 2.1 support</li>
	<li>Monitor mode, for all frame reception, and sending single frames.</li>
	<li>Master mode, with up to 15 frame slots</li>
    <li>19200 baud rate</li>	
  <li><b>Optical isolation for LIN</b></li>
  <li>External 4.5 V to 28 V is needed for LIN network</li>
  <li>Device size is 31x18 mm (without USB connector)</li>
  <li>Termination resistors controlled by software</li>
  <li>USB dfu compatible bootloader for new software</li>
  <li>SLCAN compatible, works with LINUX socket-can and some of CAN-utils</li>

<p>After USB enumeration device creates virtual COM port that is used both for data transfer and converter setup. 
     Device is be powered directly from USB, but external 4.5-28V is needed to supply LIN transceiver. 
     Board layout is shown below.<br>

<h3>Drivers</h3>
<p>For proper work on Windows no special drivers are needed </p>
<h3>COM port Commands</h3>
<p>
    Below is list of all available commands. 
    USART baud rate is virtual so can be any. 
    All commands are ASCI format. Commands are terminated with newline character CR (0xD). 
    On error the device responses with 0x7 value.

<tr>
<td>riiil</td>
<td>In Monitor mode, transmits header only with set ID and Length, subscribed slave should answer the header.<br>
    In Master mode, puts or updates table set with this id for continuous sending.
    Proper timing is set according to LIN standard. <br>
0ii: Identifier in hexadecimal format (000-0FF) <br>
