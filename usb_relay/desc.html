<!-- <h3>Drivers</h3> -->
<!-- <p>For proper work on Windows you need to install virtual com drivers from <a href="http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-utilities/stsw-stm32102.html">ST site </a> or download from <a href="/download/uccb/VirtualComportDriver.zip"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-download-alt"></i> here </a>.</p> -->

<h3>COM port Commands</h3>
<p>
    Below is list of all available commands. 
    USART baud rate is virtual so can be any. 
    All commands are ASCI format. Commands are terminated with newline character CR (0xD) '\n'. 
    On error the device responses with various error messages if command is ok then "OK\n" value is returned. 
    Relay command are in format <b>RrDdddCccc,SsPppp,SsPppp..\n</b>
